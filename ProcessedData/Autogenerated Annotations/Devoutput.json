Since the conformational distributions of large, flexible molecules may differ between liquid and vapor phases ( i.e. , good and poor solvents) [60] , the internal potential energy and enthalpy need to include the intramolecular potential energy contributions. The thermodynamic constraints for the Gibbs ensemble of the ternary mixture were N C 1 = 1276 , N C 4 = 425 , and N C 10 = 125 , P = 16.22 MPa, and T = 333 K. In the two-box Gibbs ensemble, the number fluctuations in the two boxes are identical, and the relative fluctuations are: \u03be C 1 = 0 . 109 4 , \u03be C 4 = 0 . 065 2 , and \u03be C 10 = 0 . 034 1 in the liquid phase and \u03be C 1 = 0 . 092 4 , \u03be C 4 = 0 . 176 5 , and \u03be C 10 = 0 . 50 1 in the gas phase. The mean values and uncertainties were obtained from 64 independent simulations. The input data for regression contains instantaneous values of the relevant properties from for each independent simulation at 100-cycle intervals. Parameters for quadratic regression were obtained using the analytical form of least-squares regression and hyperparameters for Gaussian process were selected using 5-fold cross-validation. For comparison, molar properties of the pure species are also provided for the stable phase at the same temperature and pressure as the ternary VLE simulations: N C 1 = 1000 , N C 4 = 800 , or N C 10 = 320 , and P = 16.22 MPa, and T = 333 K in 16 independent NPT simulations (with 50,000 MC cycles each). Uncertainties are reported as the standard error of the mean from 64 or 16 independent simulations."
