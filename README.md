# SemEvalTask9
Tables are ubiquitous in documents and presentations for conveying important information in a concise manner. This is true in many domains, stretching from scientific to government documents.  In fact,  surrounding text in these articles are often statements summarizing or highlighting some information derived from the primary source data in tables. Describing all the information provided in a table in a readable manner would be lengthy and considerably more difficult to understand. We present a task for statement verification and evidence finding using tables from scientific articles. This important task promotes proper interpretation of the surrounding article.
