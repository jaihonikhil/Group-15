         Zucali et al., 2016
        
        ).

        Assessed the sustainability of canteen meals by developing a scoring system based on nutritional requirements, environmental impacts, as well as management and production practices (
        
         Schaubroeck et al., 2018
        
        ).

         Baroni et al., 2007
        
        ).

        Compared food items on the basis of IPCC generated GHG emission values per kg protein, nutrient density, GJ, and ton of product (
        
         Doran-Browne et al., 2015
        
        ).

        Developed a sustainability index by converting different metrics to a common scale (i.e., 0–10) (
        
         Müller-Lindenlauf et al., 2010
        
        ). They evaluated organic farms differentiated by grassland percentage and feed intensity. They included environmental, animal welfare, and milk nutrition (i.e., omega-3 fatty acids, conjugated linoleic acids, and antioxidants) metrics.">

        Modeled the food system with a systems dynamic (SD) model (
        
         Sabaté et al., 2016
        
        ) by including drivers of nutrient-contents, health outcomes, and environmental degradation, in addition to more social concerns such as food sovereignty and governance.
       



        -
       

        Explored the environmental and socioeconomic changes of food systems, with a SD model, impacted by resilience factors, with food and nutrition security as outcomes (
        
         Allen and Prosperi, 2016
        
        ).

        Linked the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT), which is a partial equilibrium model to a comparative risk framework to understand the risk to health based on changes in agricultural production (
        
         Springmann et al., 2016b
        
        ).
       



        -
       

        Used IMPACT with nutritional analyses (calculated via nutrient indices) to evaluate changes in nutrient availability based on future climate scenarios (
        
         Beach et al., 2019
        
        ;

        Used a linear programming model to simulate the Swiss food supply, comprised of agricultural production, food processing, external trade, and food stock management components and linked it to environmental indicators and nutritional requirements to optimize the food supply (

        Measured the nutrient quantity of antioxidants in cauliflower, based on varying levels of mineral fertilizer added to compost, for the functional unit (FU) (
        
         Martínez-Blanco et al., 2011
        
        ).
       



        -
       

        Estimated omega-3 contents in livestock systems (e.g., beef-concentrate vs beef-forage, chicken-intensive vs. chicken-extensive) to be used as FUs (
        
         McAuliffe et al., 2018
        
        ).
       



        -
       

        Developed the Combined Nutritional and Environmental-LCA framework, which uses epidemiological studies to compare the dietary risks (e.g., stroke, colorectal cancer) and environmentally-driven health impacts (e.g., asthma from particulate matter emissions) of food items like milk (
        
         Stylianou et al., 2016
        
        ).
       



        -
       

        Compared pork items produced under different production scenarios (e.g., organic vs. conventional), while using different FU (e.g., protein) (
        
         Teixeira et al., 2013
        
        ).
       



        -
       

        Defined nutrient equivalent units (NE) as the FU, to compare vegetables in a multi-cropping system. NE was defined as the mean of the ratios between the nutrients present in a food to the DRI (
        
         Li et al., 2018
        
        ).">
