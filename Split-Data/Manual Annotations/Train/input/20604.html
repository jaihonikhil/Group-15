            I worked for a supermarket, so I know that the supermarket is also unsecure. … I have to buy foods that I feel confident about … Nutrition is important, but for me safety is most important …. First safety, second nutrition, then taste and mood. … I even go to the slaughterhouse to see how they cut the meat on a table, not on a dirty floor, then I think it is more trustworthy.

            If supermarkets would be a safer source than I would consider shopping there, it's not only about convenience, but I don't believe it. TV and newspapers reported many cases of supermarkets relabelling expired products, or pig meat from pigs that were injected with sleeping pills. Besides, supermarkets and market vendors buy from the same wholesalers.

            If the state will remove this informal street market it will affect us a lot, while in return the market doesn't affect them at all. People just start selling in their house or rent other's ground floor, to evade selling on the streets.

            It is necessary to create conditions for rural producers to do business and for elderly people to afford good food. For instance, retired people buy a bunch of vegetables at the market for 5000VND. But when they have to go to the supermarket and maybe pay double, how can they afford that? We have to take care of these people (vendors and buyers) that depend on the market.
