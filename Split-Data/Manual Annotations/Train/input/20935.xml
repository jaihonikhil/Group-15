<Table 3>
 <caption text="

   In general, when light propagates towards the surface of a material, part of the incoming radiation is transmitted and part of the incoming radiation is reflected at the boundary between the two materials. The transmitted amplitude,
   
    t
   
   , and the reflected amplitude,
   
    r
   
   , are given by Fresnel's equations [
   ,
   ] and depend on the angle of incidence,
   
    θ
   

    0
   
   , the angle of refraction,
   
    θ
   
   , and the polarization of the light. The amplitudes also depend on the refractive index of the material, which, in our case, is
   
    n
   

    0
   
   = 1 for air and
   
    n
   
   for the film, as shown in
   . The subscripts of the amplitudes indicate if the respective rays are approaching the boundary from the left (
   
    l
   
   ) or from the right (
   
    r
   
   ).
