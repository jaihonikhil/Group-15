 <caption text="

   Detailed testing protocol for all test types with all parameters and justifications of why they were chosen. The development of protocols was motivated and guided by the goals of obtaining macro-scale specimen-specific and location dependent material properties, acquiring a variety of test information via different test types, limitations of the testing system, and keeping the parameters within non-destructive physiological limits. The testing parameters were also chosen via experiential learning (e.g., number of freeze thaw cycles, number of preconditioning cycles etc.) All data were sampled at 2.5 kHz.
