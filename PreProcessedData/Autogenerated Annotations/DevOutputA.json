The line between observations 9 and 10 for HAT-P-23 b indicates the point at which the upgrade to the PIRATE telescope was undertaken. # is the observation reference number, Nobs is the number of observations per transit. Dur.(min) is the total duration of the observations and Exp.(s) is the exposure time used. RMS(ppt) is the out-of transit residual RMS scatter from the transit fit in part per thousand. CCD Mode indicates the on-chip binning used. TSNR is the Transit Signal to Noise Ratio ( Ioannidis et al., 2016 )."

The theoretical branching ratio (BR) is derived using the theoretical B(E2) and B(M1) values and the experimental transition energies. The theoretical τ 1 / 2 + is calculated using the experimental transition energy. The errors quoted for the IM-NCSM results reflect the uncertainties of the many-body method quantified through a variation of the calculation scheme and model-space size (see text). For the VS-IMSRG, we would expect the theoretical uncertainties from the many-body convergence to be similar to the IM-NCSM calculations, but did not perform a detailed analysis."

Furthermore, the resulting BDT temperatures ( T BDT ) and the applied loading rates (d K /d t ) are given. Warm-rolled materials are denoted as WR, cold rolling is indicated by CR after the value of logarithmic strain conducted by rolling. The data of the as-rolled conditions and the recrystallized material have been published in Ref. [10, 25]. Please note the slight differences in BDT temperature and chord length in comparison to Ref. [10] due to the use of different criteria for the definition of the BDT temperature and new EBSD measurements on the same materials possessing a much better statistics."

For both models, all stimulation series were delivered to rats anaesthetised with a combination of isoflurane (∼0.5 %) and intravenously administered fentanyl (20 μg/kg/h). The fact that the hippocampus consistently generated longer-lasting series of epileptiform discharges, despite receiving a shorter stimulation train (2 s) than the sensorimotor cortex in the neocortical model (5 s), illustrates its high susceptibility to neuronal hypersynchrony."
