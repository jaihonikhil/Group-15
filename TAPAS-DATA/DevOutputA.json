    "Comparison of experiment and theory. The experimental B(E2) strength is deduced from the lifetime ( τ ) of the state. The theoretical branching ratio (BR) is derived using the theoretical B(E2) and B(M1) values and the experimental transition energies. The theoretical τ 1 / 2 + is calculated using the experimental transition energy. The errors quoted for the IM-NCSM results reflect the uncertainties of the many-body method quantified through a variation of the calculation scheme and model-space size (see text). For the VS-IMSRG, we would expect the theoretical uncertainties from the many-body convergence to be similar to the IM-NCSM calculations, but did not perform a detailed analysis."

    "Centrality of Religiosity questionnaire. The centrality of religiosity for each participant was calculated using three variables per dimension (abiding by the standardized and validated model of Huber and Huber, 2012 ). The scale ranges from 1= “not religious” to 5= “highly religious”. ‘Intellect’ assesses how much a person thinks about religious questions;’ ideology’ : the presence of religious opinions and beliefs;’ public practice’: how strongly the faith is practiced in communion with others;’ private practice’: the integration of a personal prayer life;’ experience’ : how strongly one feels to be in contact with the divine."

    "shows the univariable linear mixed-effects model estimates for the change of retinal layer thicknesses over time (outcome unit: z-scores, i.e. number of normative standard deviations from the normative mean), the confidence interval (95% CI) and the corresponding p-values for retinal thickness changes in patients at baseline (intercept) and over time. For comparison, we provided also the estimates in terms of thickness deviation from the spatially corresponding normative value. However, in contrast to the z-scores, these do not take into account that the normative variability in thickness varies across the retina. Abbreviations: FRET (full retinal thickness), IRET (inner retinal thickness), ONL (outer nuclear layer), IS+OS (inner and outer photoreceptor segments), RPEDC (retinal pigment epithelium-drusen complex). Bold values highlight significant p-values <0.05"

OLS estimates with robust clustered standard errors in parentheses; standard errors are clustered at household- and interviewer-level. Further controls include marital status, age (and age squared), level of education, use of internet, religious-group membership, household size, wealth quintile (based on asset-index) and location (rural area). Regressions also include governorate fixed effects (coefficient estimates not reported). The sample comprises only those individuals that have been interviewed by a female interviewer. *** indicates p-value < 0.001, ** p-value < 0.01 and * p-value < 0.05."

OLS estimates with robust clustered standard errors in parentheses; standard errors are clustered at household- and interviewer-level. Further controls include marital status, age (and age squared), level of education, use of internet, religious-group membership, household size, wealth quintile (based on asset-index), location (rural area) and interviewer characteristics (gender, perceived religiosity). Regressions also include governorate fixed effects (coefficient estimates not reported). *** indicates p-value < 0.001, ** p-value < 0.01 and * p-value < 0.05."

    "Effect of gender inequality frame on enforcing attitudes towards gender inequality Note: Due to oversampling of rural areas, all estimations take into account survey weights OLS estimates with robust clustered standard errors in parentheses; standard errors are clustered at household- and interviewer-level. Further controls include marital status, age (and age squared), level of education, use of internet, religious-group membership, household size, wealth quintile (based on asset-index), location (rural area) and interviewer characteristics (gender, perceived religiosity). Regressions also include governorate fixed effects (coefficient estimates not reported). *** indicates p-value < 0.001, ** p-value < 0.01 and * p-value < 0.05."

    "Performance of the autonomous stem detection and of the stem reconstruction for DBH estimation. Detected trees refers to the number of point clusters, which were regarded as stems by our detection approach, Correctly detected trees is the number of these clusters which could be linked to the field reference. Valid fitted stems corresponds to the number of Detected trees , for which the cylinder fitting resulted in valid solutions, Fitted and correct stems is the number of valid stem reconstructions which could be linked to entries in the reference."

Network and corporate governance data (panels 2–4) are assembled by the authors, and are cross-sectional for 2008. Other financial/accounting data span from 2007 Q2 until 2009 Q1. ROA : return on assets (quarterly, percentage points). average return : daily average return (monthly average, percentage points). board network : number of interlocking directorates. Family network : director ties to family-owned firms. State network : director ties to state-owned firms. Political network : director ties to politically connected firms. State : indicates if firm has government blockholder. Political : indicates if firm has politically connected director. Family : indicates if firm belongs to business group. Boardsize : number of board members. Listing : year of IPO. concentration : control rights of largest blockholder (%). institutional : control rights of largest financial institution blockholder. Blockholder : indicates if any entity controls more than 10% of shares. Tangible : tangible assets - ratio of investment in plants, property, and equipment to total assets. Cash : relative to total assets. Liabilities : total liabilities - short and long term obligations. Volatility : realized return volatility (quarterly, standard deviation of daily realized return). leverage : ratio of total liabilities to total assets. ROE : return on equity (quarterly, percentage points). sales : total sales (log). size : total assets (log). mature debt : debt maturing within one year (scaled by assets). account payable : calculated over assets. Skill : % of board members who have either an industry-specific or financial background. cv : total number of board members with publicly disclosed background. Experience : average number of years each board member has been on the board. Affiliations : average number of other corporate affiliations for the board member."
