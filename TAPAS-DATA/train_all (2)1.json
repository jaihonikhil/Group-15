    "Lender-level results - loan spreads and number of subsidiaries. This table reports results from lender-level regression of loan spread on the number of subsidiaries. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of loan spread ( LogSpread ). The variable of interest is the natural logarithm and rank groupings of the number of subsidiaries. Included are loan controls for loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."

    "Using residuals from predicted number of subsidiaries. This table reports results from the prediction model of the number of subsidiaries and the second stage estimation of loan interest spread on the residuals from the prediction model. The dependent variable in the prediction model is the natural logarithm of the number of subsidiaries ( LogNumSubs ) and in the second stage is the natural logarithm of loan spread ( LogSpread ). The variables of interest are residuals from the prediction model with industry fixed effects ( Residual1 ) and with firm fixed effects ( Residual2 ). Included are loan controls loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). The prediction includes two additional factors associated with the number of subsidiaries ( LogEmployees , RepatCost ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."

    "Alternative measures to the number of subsidiaries. This table reports results from an OLS regression of loan spread on alternative measures to the number of exhibit 21 subsidiaries. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of loan spread ( LogSpread ). The variables of interest are the natural logarithm of the number of subsidiaries that borrow in the same year as the parent company ( LogTier1Subs , LogTier2Subs ) and the natural logarithm of the number of CEO or CFO in a firm's corporate family ( LogNumExecs ). Included are loan controls loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."

    "Effects of subsidiaries by location - domestic, foreign and Delaware. This table reports results from separate regressions of loan spread on the number of subsidiaries by location. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of loan spread ( LogSpread ). The variables of interest are domestic subsidiaries ( LogDSubs ), foreign subsidiaries ( LogFSubs ), and domestic subsidiaries incorporated in Delaware ( LogDeSubs ). Included are loan controls loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."

    "Single and multi-segment firm-years. This table reports results from separate regressions of loan spread on the number of subsidiaries for firm-years with (i) single SIC vs multi-SIC and (ii) domestic sales only vs multinational firms. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of loan spread ( LogSpread ). The variable of interest is the natural logarithm and rank groupings of the number of subsidiaries. Included are loan controls for loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."

    "Further evidence for the mechanism – equity ratio. This table reports results from an OLS regression of loan spread on equity ratio and the number of subsidiaries. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of loan spread ( LogSpread ). The variables of interest are equity ratio ( EquityRatio ), natural logarithm of the number of subsidiaries ( LogNumSubs ), and the interaction between LogNumSubs * EquityRatio . Included are loan controls loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."

    "Selected non-price loan terms. This table reports results from separate regressions of individual loan terms on quintile groups of the number of subsidiaries. Each column header is the dependent variable. The variable of interest is the quartile group of the number of subsidiaries. Included are loan controls (excluding the term in the dependent variable) for loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."

    "Potential mechanism – minority interest. This table reports results from an OLS regression of loan spread on minority interest and the number of subsidiaries. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of loan spread ( LogSpread ). The variables of interest are minority interest ( MinorityInt ), natural logarithm of the number of subsidiaries ( LogNumSubs ), and the interaction between LogNumSubs * MinorityInt . Included are loan controls loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."

    "Baseline results - loan spreads and number of subsidiaries. This table reports results from an OLS regression of loan spread on the number of subsidiaries. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of loan spread ( LogSpread ). The variable of interest is the natural logarithm and rank groupings of the number of subsidiaries. Included are loan controls loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."

    "The impact of temperature shocks on wheat and wine prices in Savoy, 1717–92. Notes: OLS estimations. Robust standard errors and p-values in parentheses and brackets respectively. In columns 1 to 3, the dependent variable is the log of wheat prices in grams of silver per litre in province i during after harvest time (Autumn) in year t (1717–92). In columns 4 and 5, the dependent variable is log of red wine prices in grams of silver per litre in the city of Annecy in year t (1741–89). The independent variable Temperature is the summer temperature deviation from the long-term seasonal mean (1500–1600) in province i , divided by its standard deviation. The other independent variables are defined accordingly. Province FE is a set of province fixed effects."

    "The impact of temperature shocks on crime rates in Savoy, 1749–92. Notes: The sample is a balance panel of provinces covering 1749–92. Panel linear estimations with province fixed effects and year fixed effects. Cluster bootstrapped standard errors ( Cameron et al., 2008 ) and p-values in parentheses and brackets respectively. In columns 1 and 4, the dependent variable is the log of total number of crimes per 100,000 inhabitants in province i during season s in year t . In columns 2, 3, 5 and 6, the dependent variables are defined accordingly for violent and property crime. In columns 1 to 3, the independent variable Temperature is the seasonal temperature deviation from the long-term seasonal mean (1500–1600) in province i , divided by its standard deviation. In columns 4 to 6, the share of each cell in the mean seasonal temperature of province i is weighted by the share of the cell’s soil suitability to grow wheat in the total soil suitability of province i . Weighted temperature is then defined accordingly. Province FE is a full set of province fixed effects. Year FE is a full set of year fixed effects."

    "The impact of seasonal migration on physical violence and petty theft of food. Notes: The sample is a balance panel of provinces covering 1749–92. Panel linear estimations with province fixed effects and year fixed effects. Cluster bootstrapped standard errors ( Cameron et al., 2008 ) and p-values in parentheses and brackets respectively. In columns 1 to 3, the dependent variable is the log of total number of physical violence against persons (exlcuding homicide) per 100,000 inhabitants in province i during season s in year t . In columns 4 to 6, the dependent variable is the log of total number of thefts of edible products per 100,000 inhabitants in province i during season s in year t . In columns 1 to 6, the independent variable Temperature is the seasonal temperature deviation from the long-term seasonal mean (1500–1600) in province i , divided by its standard deviation. Migration dummy is a binary variable equal to one if the average seasonal migration rate in province i is above the Savoyard mean, and zero otherwise. Migration rate is a continuous variable equal to the rate of seasonal migration in province i . Province FE is a full set of province fixed effects. Year FE is a full set of year fixed effects."

    "Partial molar properties (including intramolecular potential energy contributions but excluding kinetic energy terms) from regressing simulation trajectories of natural gas condensates. Since the conformational distributions of large, flexible molecules may differ between liquid and vapor phases ( i.e. , good and poor solvents) [60] , the internal potential energy and enthalpy need to include the intramolecular potential energy contributions. The thermodynamic constraints for the Gibbs ensemble of the ternary mixture were N C 1 = 1276 , N C 4 = 425 , and N C 10 = 125 , P = 16.22 MPa, and T = 333 K. In the two-box Gibbs ensemble, the number fluctuations in the two boxes are identical, and the relative fluctuations are: ξ C 1 = 0 . 109 4 , ξ C 4 = 0 . 065 2 , and ξ C 10 = 0 . 034 1 in the liquid phase and ξ C 1 = 0 . 092 4 , ξ C 4 = 0 . 176 5 , and ξ C 10 = 0 . 50 1 in the gas phase. The mean values and uncertainties were obtained from 64 independent simulations. The input data for regression contains instantaneous values of the relevant properties from for each independent simulation at 100-cycle intervals. Parameters for quadratic regression were obtained using the analytical form of least-squares regression and hyperparameters for Gaussian process were selected using 5-fold cross-validation. For comparison, molar properties of the pure species are also provided for the stable phase at the same temperature and pressure as the ternary VLE simulations: N C 1 = 1000 , N C 4 = 800 , or N C 10 = 320 , and P = 16.22 MPa, and T = 333 K in 16 independent NPT simulations (with 50,000 MC cycles each). Uncertainties are reported as the standard error of the mean from 64 or 16 independent simulations."

    "Summary of the microstructural properties. For each material condition and microstructural property, two values are given. The values written in the first row are related to EBSD scans of the cross-section defined by the rolling direction (RD) and the normal direction (ND) of the sheets. This applies for the properties: chord lengths for HABs and chord length for all boundaries ( λ - H A B , λ - a l l ), the boundary density of HABs and the boundary density for all boundaries ( S - V , H A B , S - V , a l l ), and the fractions of HABs, LABs and CSL boundaries ( x - H A B , x - L A B , x - C S L ). The fraction of CSL boundaries include all CSL boundaries from Σ3 to Σ25 (Brandon’s criterion, exponent was set to −0.5) which are also included in the fraction of high-angle boundaries. For the aspect ratio of grains and the aspect ratio of subgrains ( r - H A B , r - a l l ), the number of the first row gives the elongation of the grains and subgrains parallel to RD expressed as times the chord length. The bracketed values in the second row provide the derived results based on scans of the cross-section defined by the transverse direction (TD) and ND. The aspect ratios written down in the second row describe the elongation parallel to TD. For calculating the aspect ratios the mean values for chord length were used generated by the result from the cross-sections defined by the RD and the ND and by the TD and the ND as well. Dislocation densities were taken from an earlier publication [63] ."

Note that the three-way interaction had to be excluded for P . peregrina because of zero values for all replicates of a certain treatment combination, and that zero inflation was only present in the datasets of T . pratensis and P . peregrina .

The values obtained at both room temperature (21 °C) and at 37 °C, the temperature at which the lipase inhibitory activity assay is performed, are presented. Note that at 37 °C only the buffer at concentration 0.15 M can maintain the pH above 8 when the sample at pH 3.63 is added. Tris–HCl 0.05 M pH 8.5 is the buffer used in other published methods."

    "The impact of seasonal migration on physical violence and petty theft of food. Notes: The sample is a balance panel of provinces covering 1749–92. Panel linear estimations with province fixed effects and year fixed effects. Cluster bootstrapped standard errors ( Cameron et al., 2008 ) and p-values in parentheses and brackets respectively. In columns 1 to 3, the dependent variable is the log of total number of physical violence against persons (exlcuding homicide) per 100,000 inhabitants in province i during season s in year t . In columns 4 to 6, the dependent variable is the log of total number of thefts of edible products per 100,000 inhabitants in province i during season s in year t . In columns 1 to 6, the independent variable Temperature is the seasonal temperature deviation from the long-term seasonal mean (1500–1600) in province i , divided by its standard deviation. Migration dummy is a binary variable equal to one if the average seasonal migration rate in province i is above the Savoyard mean, and zero otherwise. Migration rate is a continuous variable equal to the rate of seasonal migration in province i . Province FE is a full set of province fixed effects. Year FE is a full set of year fixed effects."

    "The impact of seasonal migration. Notes: The sample is a balance panel of provinces covering 1749–92. Panel linear estimations with province fixed effects and year fixed effects. Cluster bootstrapped standard errors Cameron et al. (2008) and p-values in parentheses and brackets respectively. In columns 1 and 2, the dependent variable is the log of total number of crimes per 100,000 inhabitants in province i during season s in year t . In columns 3 to 6, the dependent variables are defined accordingly for violent and property crime. In columns 1 to 6, the independent variable Temperature is the seasonal temperature deviation from the long-term seasonal mean (1500–1600) in province i , divided by its standard deviation. Migration dummy is a binary variable equal to one if the average seasonal migration rate in province i is above the Savoyard mean, and zero otherwise. Migration rate is a continuous variable equal to the rate of seasonal migration in province i . Province FE is a full set of province fixed effects. Year FE is a full set of year fixed effects."

(24) , and the CFC-NPT ensemble [12,22] . The reported residual reaction enthalpies are relative to the reaction enthalpy at ideal gas conditions, as the contributions from the enthalpies of formation of N 2 , H 2 , and NH 3 are not included here in Δ h ¯ . The magnitude of the fluctuations for the number of ammonia molecules, ξ NH 3 = 〈 n NH 3 2 〉 − 〈 n NH 3 〉 2 / 〈 n NH 3 〉 , in the reaction ensemble is provided.

    "Partial molar properties (including intramolecular potential energy contributions but excluding kinetic energy terms) from regressing simulation trajectories of natural gas condensates. Since the conformational distributions of large, flexible molecules may differ between liquid and vapor phases ( i.e. , good and poor solvents) [60] , the internal potential energy and enthalpy need to include the intramolecular potential energy contributions. The thermodynamic constraints for the Gibbs ensemble of the ternary mixture were N C 1 = 1276 , N C 4 = 425 , and N C 10 = 125 , P = 16.22 MPa, and T = 333 K. In the two-box Gibbs ensemble, the number fluctuations in the two boxes are identical, and the relative fluctuations are: ξ C 1 = 0 . 109 4 , ξ C 4 = 0 . 065 2 , and ξ C 10 = 0 . 034 1 in the liquid phase and ξ C 1 = 0 . 092 4 , ξ C 4 = 0 . 176 5 , and ξ C 10 = 0 . 50 1 in the gas phase. The mean values and uncertainties were obtained from 64 independent simulations. The input data for regression contains instantaneous values of the relevant properties from for each independent simulation at 100-cycle intervals. Parameters for quadratic regression were obtained using the analytical form of least-squares regression and hyperparameters for Gaussian process were selected using 5-fold cross-validation. For comparison, molar properties of the pure species are also provided for the stable phase at the same temperature and pressure as the ternary VLE simulations: N C 1 = 1000 , N C 4 = 800 , or N C 10 = 320 , and P = 16.22 MPa, and T = 333 K in 16 independent NPT simulations (with 50,000 MC cycles each). Uncertainties are reported as the standard error of the mean from 64 or 16 independent simulations."

    "Summary of the microstructural properties. For each material condition and microstructural property, two values are given. The values written in the first row are related to EBSD scans of the cross-section defined by the rolling direction (RD) and the normal direction (ND) of the sheets. This applies for the properties: chord lengths for HABs and chord length for all boundaries ( λ - H A B , λ - a l l ), the boundary density of HABs and the boundary density for all boundaries ( S - V , H A B , S - V , a l l ), and the fractions of HABs, LABs and CSL boundaries ( x - H A B , x - L A B , x - C S L ). The fraction of CSL boundaries include all CSL boundaries from Σ3 to Σ25 (Brandon’s criterion, exponent was set to −0.5) which are also included in the fraction of high-angle boundaries. For the aspect ratio of grains and the aspect ratio of subgrains ( r - H A B , r - a l l ), the number of the first row gives the elongation of the grains and subgrains parallel to RD expressed as times the chord length. The bracketed values in the second row provide the derived results based on scans of the cross-section defined by the transverse direction (TD) and ND. The aspect ratios written down in the second row describe the elongation parallel to TD. For calculating the aspect ratios the mean values for chord length were used generated by the result from the cross-sections defined by the RD and the ND and by the TD and the ND as well. Dislocation densities were taken from an earlier publication [63] ."

    "Thickness reduction by rolling and preheating temperatures. The materials’ labeling represents the logarithmic strain conducted by warm- and cold-rolling ( ε L o g ) extended by the rolling temperatures (warm-rolling: WR and cold-rolling: CR). The relative reductions ( Δ t ) in percent are listed in comparison to the hot-rolled (HR) state. The preheating temperatures ( T P r e h e a t i n g ) selected for warm- and cold-rolling are expressed as homologous temperatures, i.e. as a fraction of the melting temperature ( T M e l t ), which is around 3700 K for pure W [17] ."

Note that the three-way interaction had to be excluded for P . peregrina because of zero values for all replicates of a certain treatment combination, and that zero inflation was only present in the datasets of T . pratensis and P . peregrina .

The values obtained at both room temperature (21 °C) and at 37 °C, the temperature at which the lipase inhibitory activity assay is performed, are presented. Note that at 37 °C only the buffer at concentration 0.15 M can maintain the pH above 8 when the sample at pH 3.63 is added. Tris–HCl 0.05 M pH 8.5 is the buffer used in other published methods."
