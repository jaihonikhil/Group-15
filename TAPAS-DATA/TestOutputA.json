Based on the Inhbition %, the following consideration was adopted: No antimutagenic effect – Inhibition <25%. Moderate antimutagenic effect – Inhibition ranging from 25%−40%. Strong antimutagenic effect – Inhibition greater than 40%."

Furthermore, the resulting BDT temperatures ( T BDT ) and the applied loading rates (d K /d t ) are given. Warm-rolled materials are denoted as WR, cold rolling is indicated by CR after the value of logarithmic strain conducted by rolling. The data of the as-rolled conditions and the recrystallized material have been published in Ref. [10, 25]. Please note the slight differences in BDT temperature and chord length in comparison to Ref. [10] due to the use of different criteria for the definition of the BDT temperature and new EBSD measurements on the same materials possessing a much better statistics."

    "Properties of W sheets in the as-rolled and annealed state. Results of the as-rolled sheet are taken from Ref. [ 13 ]. This table gives a summary of the BDT temperature ( T BDT ), mean chord lengths ( λ ¯ ) and the dislocation density ( ρ D ) before and after heat treatment (1300 K, 6 h). The density of boundaries (surface per unit volume) with disorientation angles above 2° ( S V ) is also provided. Furthermore, the mean disorientation angle ( θ ¯ ) is given. For calculation of the fractions of low-angle boundaries ( x LAB ) and high-angle boundaries ( x HAB ), threshold angles of 2° and 15° were chosen, respectively. The fraction of CSL boundaries ( x CSL ) includes all CSL boundaries from Σ3 to Σ25 (Brandon's criterion, exponent was set to −0.5) which are also included in the fraction of high-angle boundaries. The standard deviation was calculated between values of the four EBSD scans for each of the samples respectively."

PD is the probability that an image belonging in a class will be classified as a that taxon.

SP is the probability that the classifier's prediction is correct for each taxon. NA is not applicable. All data are counts, except SP and PD, which are percentages."

List of all CYP45082C proteins identified from C. tinctorius with their corresponding physical and chemical characteristics including protein length, isoelectric points (PI), molecular weight (MW; Da), instability index, and GRAV. The data was collected using ExPASy tool. (available online: http://web.expasy.org/protparam/ ). The subcellular localization prediction of each gene was predicted using the cello web server ( http://cello.life.nctu.edu.tw/ ) and WoLF PSORT ( https://wolfpsort.hgc.jp/ ). Various other physical properties such as presumptive gene names, and accession numbers were also identified."
