*Note*: Most of the code in this folder has been taken as base from the official repository ( https://github.com/wenhuchen/GNN-TabFact.git , https://github.com/wenhuchen/Table-Fact-Checking.git ) with few modification according to our needs. There was a error in the model.py in the repository which was corrected during implementation and pull request has been in the official repository.

Accuracy on test set : 69.71 %
